//! The mount points this daemon created, by machine name. Only these are
//! ever unmounted: whatever else sits under the root is not ours.
//!
//! An entry lives until its mount is gone — through a failed release and
//! the retries after it — so shutdown and a lagged receiver still find it.
//! A generation tells a retry whether the name was remounted in between:
//! the retry must not unmount a newer machine's root at the same path.
//!
//! Each entry carries the machine's [`HostHold`], which keeps a force stop
//! from killing the VM while the mount is up. The hold goes with the first
//! release attempt, successful or not: a release that failed is retried
//! against a server that may already be gone, and holding the VM for it
//! would only delay the stop.
