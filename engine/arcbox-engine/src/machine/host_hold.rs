//! Host-side holds on a running machine.
//!
//! The host may keep resources a machine serves: the daemon mounts a
//! machine's root over NFS from the machine's own agent. Killing the VM
//! while such a mount is up leaves the client with requests no server will
//! answer, and only a forced unmount, after its timeout, gets rid of them —
//! a `remove --force` took ~15 s that way. A holder therefore registers a
//! [`HostHold`] while it depends on the machine and drops it once the
//! `MachineStopping` event has made it let go; every stop waits, bounded,
//! for the holds to clear before it touches the VM. The graceful stop
//! waits too: its shutdown RPC kills the machine's export within moments
//! on alpine, before an unmount started at the event has finished.
